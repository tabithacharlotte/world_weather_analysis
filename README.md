# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project

At the most fundamental level, Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.


### Purpose

PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.

## Resources

- Data Source: 
- Software: JupyterNotebook , Pandas Library, CitiPy, Python, APIs, JSON Traversals, Matplotlib, SciPy

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis Description

Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

Collect the Data

Use the NumPy module to generate more than 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes.
Use the citipy module to list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to request the current weather data from each unique city in your list.
Parse the JSON data from the API request.
Collect the following data from the JSON file and add it to a DataFrame:
City, country, and date
Latitude and longitude
Maximum temperature
Humidity
Cloudiness
Wind speed

Exploratory Analysis with Visualization

Create scatter plots of the weather data for the following comparisons:
Latitude versus temperature
Latitude versus humidity
Latitude versus cloudiness
Latitude versus wind speed
Determine the correlations for the following weather data:
Latitude and temperature
Latitude and humidity
Latitude and cloudiness
Latitude and wind speed
Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the following:
Latitude and temperature
Latitude and humidity
Latitude and cloudiness
Latitude and wind speed

Visualize Travel Data

Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences. Complete these steps:

Filter the Pandas DataFrame based on user inputs for a minimum and maximum temperature.
Create a heatmap for the new DataFrame.
Find a hotel from the cities' coordinates using Google's Maps and Places API, and Search Nearby feature.
Store the name of the first hotel in the DataFrame.
Add pop-up markers to the heatmap that display information about the city, current maximum temperature, and a hotel in the city.
